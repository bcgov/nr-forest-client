<p>The nr-forest-client is a node.js application built with <a
href="https://vuejs.org">Vue.js</a> in typescript as frontend, <a
href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot#learn">Spring boot java</a>
as backend, postgres and oracle for database, integrated with the <a
href="https://github.com/bcgov/greenfield-template">greenfield-template</a>
to automate the process for testing, security scanning, code quality
checking, image building and deploying.</p>
<h2 id="frontend">Frontend</h2>
<p>The frontend is built in Vue3 composition api, more info <a
href="frontend/index.html">here</a></p>
<h2 id="backend">Backend</h2>
<p>The backend is built in Java 17 using Spring Boot 3. It is composed
of multiple components, more info about the <a
href="backend/index.html">backend here</a>, the <a
href="legacy/index.html">legacy</a> part that handles oracle connections
and the <a href="processor/index.html">processor</a> that handles the
submission processing part.</p>

<h2 id="automated-end-to-end-tests">Automated End-to-End tests</h2>
<p>For automated end-to-end tests with cypress you can check <a
href="cypress/index.html">here</a>. This is used to validate user
journeys and some other cases.</p>
<h2 id="database-schema-documentation">Database Schema
documentation</h2>
<p>As the application evolves, so does the data, and to control the
evolution of the database that stores all this new data. To make it in a
controllable way, we can apply the same strategy we use for our codebase
into our database. To achieve that, we can use tools that will version
and apply changes into the database in a controlled way. Team Alliance
decided to make use of <a
href="https://documentation.red-gate.com/flyway">Flyway</a> as the
de-facto tool to database versioning. This means that we can recreate
the database structure as many times as we need, along with basic data
that needs to be inserted into the database.</p>
<p>We have the database schema documented using <a
href="https://schemaspy.org/">SchemaSpy</a>. This is particularly useful
tool for database administrators, developers, and analysts who need to
understand the structure and relationships within a database. This allow
us to automatically generate a visualization of the database schema
through Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams. These diagrams help users
quickly grasp the relationships between tables, making it easier to
navigate and understand complex databases.</p>
<p>You can find our database diagram on <a
href="https://bcgov.github.io/nr-forest-client/schema/nrfc/relationships.html">this
page</a> and more information about the database on <a
href="https://bcgov.github.io/nr-forest-client/schema">this page</a></p>
