The nr-forest-client-api application provides the API that allows systems to consume forest client data without having to connect to a database. We are working the process to publish our API  

The nr-forest-client-api is a node.js application built with [nestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com), integrated with the [greenfield-template](https://github.com/bcgov/greenfield-template) to automate the process for testing, security scanning, code quality checking, image building and deploying. It is hosted in openshift, protected and published through [API Services Portal](https://api.gov.bc.ca/)
