        ## üìù Gherkin Scenario Submission

        Thank you for contributing! Please provide your Gherkin scenario in the format below. 

        ### Gherkin/Cucumber Test Scenario
        - ‚úçÔ∏è **Write or paste your Gherkin scenario in the first block**:  
          - Ensure the scenario follows the structure of **Given**, **When**, **Then**.
          - Ensure the scenario contains a **Feature** and **Scenario** instruction.
          - You can have multiple **Scenarios** in a single **Feature**.
          - Pay attention to the **indentation** and **keywords**, as misconfigured files will cause issues when executed.
          - Pay attention to the data you're using in your scenario. Make sure it don't pose a security risk or exposes any **REAL** [personal identifiable information](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/information-management-technology/privacy/personal-information).
